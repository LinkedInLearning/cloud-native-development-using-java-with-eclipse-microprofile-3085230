Many developers are building cloud-native applications and are looking for ways to create maintainable, resilient, and performant applications. Eclipse MicroProfile optimizes enterprise Java applications for cloud native and microservices architectures. The specifications have been created by experts in the community and are backed by companies such as IBM, RedHat, Oracle, Tomitribe, and Payaraâ€”which makes it a great choice for developers like you.


In this hands-on course, software engineer Kate Stanley introduces MicroProfile and some of the fundamental specifications available, as well as how to add those specifications to an existing Open Liberty application. Kate also covers how to start bringing in higher-level MicroProfile specifications as your cloud-native applications mature.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
